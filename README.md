Overview
------
With the rapid advancement of high-throughput histology technologies, the need for multidimensional and big data visualization is increasing along with the rapid increase of big biological data. Technological high speed innovation researchers have developed various bioinformatics software, software packages and other tools to draw visualization graphs, but also require users to have a basic knowledge of various programming languages. More and more users need comprehensive, fast, easy and intuitive retrieval of the information contained in big data. Easier visualization of large histological data to solve biological problems is extremely important.
For this purpose, we designed the heat map visualization software DataColor. the tool provides comprehensive adjustment parameters and integrates a large number of general-purpose base and cluster heatmap, as well as isoheight plotter, 3D plotters, treemap, calendar plotter, bubble plotter, network plotter, geographic map, wordcloud plotter, anatomogram plotter, etc., and allows comparison on the same platform of different 21 results under different drawing tools on the same platform.
